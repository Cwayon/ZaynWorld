                    The Sun Ultra series is a discontinued line of workstation
                    and server computers developed and sold by Sun Microsystems,
                    comprising two distinct generations. The original line was
                    introduced in 1995 and discontinued in 2001. This generation
                    was partially replaced by the Sun Blade in 2000 and that
                    line was in itself replaced by the Sun Java Workstation—an
                    AMD Opteron system—in 2004. In sync with the transition to
                    x86-64-architecture processors, in 2005 the Ultra brand was
                    later revived with the launch of the Ultra 20 and Ultra 40,
                    albeit to some confusion, since they were no longer based on
                    UltraSPARC processors. </q
                ><br />
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun_Ultra_series"

                <p>
                    2006 was the year that the final UltraSPARC based systems
                    were introduced, namely the Ultra 25 and Ultra 45. The
                    following x86 Sun Ultra Workstations used AMD Opteron, Intel
                    Core 2 Duo and Intel Xeon processors.<br />The main
                    difference between the two final UltraSPARC workstations was
                    that the Ultra 45 could contain upto two UltraSPARC
                    processors, also making the Ultra 45 a much larger chassis
                    than the Ultra 25, depth-wise.

                    I was lucky to get my hands on this chassis empty off ebay
                    for £30. Unfortunately it did not come complete in all its
                    SPARC glory.

                <h4>Mounting a standard ATX motherboard</h4>
                <p>
                    There are many methods for achieving this. I would consider
                    it the stage that requires most planning. Depending how you
                    do this will affect how any PCI accessories will mount if at
                    all, and will determine how much space you have left over in
                    the chassis. <br />Personally I found the simplest and most
                    fail-proof (and laziest) way of mounting a motherboard would
                    be to use an already fitting backplate from another standard
                    ATX chassis and mount this to the Ultra 45 like an adapter.
                    You can see the a demonstration of this in my video above.
                    Others have tapped new standoffs directly into the Ultra 45.
                    This is by far a more elegant solution and will require a
                    little more effort. See how this can be on

                        alt="Sun Ultra 45 motherboard backplate mount"
                    /><br />Note: The Sun Ultra 45 will fit an ATX motherboard,
                    dimensions-wise. In my example I have used an mATX
                    motherboard, so the mounting process will be different.

                <h4>Mounting PCI expansion cards</h4>
                <p>
                    Only a lightweight GPU is featured in my build, I could
                    replace this with a heavier GPU since this PCIe accessory is
                    fixed against the chassis' PCI expansion slots; it will hold
                    stable.<br /><br /><img

                </p>
                <h4>Front IO and fitting 3.5 inch bay accessories</h4>
                <p>
                    The front Io slot was once occupied by an optical drive,
                    front io ports and buttons. The Chassis I purchased did not
                    come with this panel. The slot will barely fit a 3.5 inch
                    bay accessory such as a standard optical drive. There will
                    be however, minor gaps and it is a very tight fit. To allow
                    an optical drive and most 3.5 inch bay accessories cutting
                    and removing fairings from the inside of the bay is required
                    since some plastics and metal stick out in the way. This
                    space is tight and will be difficult to modify. This space
                    can be seen towards the end of the video above.
                </p>
                <h4>Fitting a standard ATX PSU</h4>
                <p>
                    The Sun Ultra 45 will fit a standard ATX PSU upto great
                    lengths. The issue though, is that it will not be flush
                    against the back of the chassis since the original PSU was
                    shorter than the new standard ATX size. There will be a gap.
                    This means that you will not be able to screw in the PSU
                    without cutting some of the protruding metal. Fixing the PSU
                    in place to stop it from moving around will require
                    improvisation.<br />There is a green thumb screw and slider
                    on the bottom of the chassis. This is only for the original
                    PSU and will not fit any other. They will not obstruct any
                    standard PSU.

                <h4>Connecting HDDs/SSDs via the original Backplane</h4>
                <p>
                    The Sun Ultra 45 backplane has four SATA connections for
                    storage drives. This board has an SCSI SFF-8484 connector
                    which can be converted to four separate SATA connections via
                    an adapter. This and powering the backplane are further
                    explained in
                    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVsvH2fJPg4"
                        >Trung Lê's YouTube video</a
                    >.<br />The build featured in the above video does not use
                    the original backplane.

                <h4>Mounting Fans</h4>
                <p>
                    There are no mounting screw holes for any fans throughout
                    the chassis. The original build has proprietary fan modules
                    to control airflow. Mounting fans will require
                    improvisation. There are enough grills and holes to figure
                    something out.<br /><br /><img

                <h4>This particular setup</h4>
                <p>
                    I will only mention some notes regarding this particular
                    setup I put together. If you are considering attempting an
                    EGPU build of your own I reccomend reasearching the topic
                    and finding similar already completed builds with success on
                    the <a href="https://egpu.io">EGPU.io</a> and
                    <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/eGPU/">Reddit EGPU</a>
                    forums. There are many factors you will have to consider
                    when venturing with EGPUs as there is so much uncertainty
                    throughout the entire process.

                <h4>Notes:</h4>
                <p>
                    The Thinkpad x230 tablet happens to be quite a good
                    candidate for expresscard EGPU solutions compared to many
                    others in the same category. The Generation 3 Mobile CPU
                    (not Ultrabook CPU) is a very good performer despite its age
                    and power consumption. Compared to many other laptops with
                    an Expresscard 34 or 54 slot, the Core i5-3320m is among the
                    highest performers. This will reduce bottlenecking when
                    using the laptop with an EGPU.<br />It is highly reccomended
                    when using any of x/t_20/30 Thinkpads to only install 8gb of
                    ram maximum. It is generally accepted that by installing
                    16gb on these models, issues will undoubtedly arise when
                    egpu-ing.<br />Generally the trend is: the older the GPU,
                    the less issues you will have during setup and
                    compatability. Pascal based Nvidia cards are to be avoided
                    due to compatability, however are sometimes workable. Most
                    Nvidia cards can output to internal and external displays
                    whilst AMD cards will only output an image to an external
                    display. This is not much of an issue since using the
                    internal display heavily bottlenecks the expresscard lanes
                    making external diaplay use only viable in our situation
                    here.<br />A common error to occur during setup is the error
                    code "42". This is related to drivers. Through many attempts
                    of trial and error for my particular setup Nvida Drivers
                    version <b>381.65</b> had the least issues. Other known
                    versions that are known to bypass this error is version
                    <b>375.63</b>. For Nvidia 10 Series Pascal cards with this
                    error, versions <b>372.20</b> and <b>372.70</b> might do the
                    trick.<br />You cannot hot plug an expresscard connection,
                    You must restart the machine on connect and disconnect.<br />EGPU
                    setups such as this are workable on linux, I havent tried it
                    myself however.

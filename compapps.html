<h3>2020/10/23 Reflecting on my Digital Identity</h3> <A NAME="week3"></a>
	<h4>Google</h4>
	<p>If I google my own full name, out of the top 10 results, 5 of them are directly related to me, being profiles I own such as Linkedin and instagram. One result was a friend of mine, who I have connected to via Keybase. <br> There are so many results relating to me, since my name is not common. My last name is rare, and my first name is at most uncommon. Personally I would prefer to have less direct results since it would make it more difficult to find information leading to me but I also see this as a pro in some cases. Potential pro's include ease for employers to find academic details about me and cons include most other people having this freedom. Ideally I wish nobody to see my details however it can't be helped. I have never been very active on facebook and this social media will not show any details that may hinder my career prospects. The social Media I am active on will have a username not relating to my real name and I will make extra effort to make sure there is no connection between them. My Linkedin is the first result, as much as I hate Linkedin, it might be helpful in the future so that being the first result is helpful.<br>I have Just setup a Google alert for my name, thanks for the heads up.</p>
	<h4>Facebook</h4>
	<p>My Public Profile only shows my display picture, cover photo, Name and location. I am comfortable with this information as it shows just enough to enable one to know if this is the same Zayn as they may think it is, but not enough for one to to learn much about me. If an employer saw this page, I would feel okay, there is nothing to hide, even if my account was fully public.<br>The Facebook Friends Script didn't work for me unfortunately on multiple browsers.<br>I have my privacy settings set to Friends of friends, I may change this, unsure at the moment. It is a little concerning to think about the number of people that can see my posts, even if I don't have any posts.<br>The only two apps that have access to some of my data are Quizup and Patreon, I remember signing up to Quizup and playing the quizes years ago but I didn't know I used facebook at the time. Patreon I had no idea I signed up for it! I may have to remove these!</p>
